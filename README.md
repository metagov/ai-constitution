# ai-constitution
A computational constitution to facilitate user- and community-based governance of AI models and services.

This constitution is intended to be adopted and used by a producer of AI and statistical models as a mechanism for devolving specific power and governance responsibilities to users, communities, and society at large. It is simultaneously a set of rules for governing AI, a legal contract between the developer of the AI model and a set of parties, and a functional community application that offers a set of affordances to user communities and which helps them organize, coordinate, and evolve.
